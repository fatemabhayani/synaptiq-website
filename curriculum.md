SynaptIQ Academy aligns with the Ontario Ministry of Education’s curriculum — respected for rigor, clarity, and balance. Every grade level and subject in our K–12 program is grounded in the expectations, strands, and achievement charts outlined in the Ontario Curriculum.

But we don’t stop there. We apply AI personalization, ethical integration, real-world relevance, and interdisciplinary creativity to prepare learners for a world that changes faster than any static syllabus.
