# Frequently Asked Questions

**Clarity. Confidence. Connection.**

## For K–12 Families
### What curriculum does SynaptIQ Academy follow?
We follow the Canadian Ontario Curriculum, enhanced through AI-personalized mastery learning. Students complete core academic requirements while engaging in deep thinking, creativity, communication, and moral reasoning — all mapped to Ontario Ministry of Education expectations.

### How is AI used in your academic model?
The SynaptIQ Engine™ adapts to each learner’s pace and level using Canadian curriculum benchmarks. Students receive real-time feedback, mastery checkpoints, and personalized lesson pathways, allowing us to support and stretch every learner.

### What does a typical school day look like?
We operate a full-day program from 8:00 AM to 3:00 PM, balancing AI-personalized academics, guided ethical discussion, real-world skill-building, creative collaboration, and wellness. Each day follows the SynaptIQ Cycle™ — six learning blocks that develop the whole child.

### Are there teachers?
We employ mentors and learning guides — trained educators who facilitate critical discussion, coach emotional intelligence, and guide students in projects and communication. They are role models, not just content deliverers.

### Is SynaptIQ a good fit for my child?
Yes, if your child is curious and self-motivated, wants more meaning from school, benefits from small class sizes and mentorship, and thrives when seen and heard. We welcome learners who want to grow intellectually and ethically.

### Do you support gifted or neurodiverse learners?
Yes. The adaptive nature of our AI platform — combined with small cohorts and 1:1 mentoring — supports diverse learning profiles, including gifted and neurodivergent students.

### What about extracurriculars and physical activity?
Movement, play, and creativity are embedded in the school day through outdoor education, arts and maker sessions, passion clubs, community excursions, and emotional wellness breaks. These are not “extras.” They are essential.

### Do students take tests? How is progress measured?
We focus on mastery, not memorization. Assessments are ongoing, personalized, and aligned with Ontario standards. Students progress when they understand — not just when they complete. We use AI-powered assessments, portfolios, mentor reflections, and Ontario report card frameworks.

### How do parents stay involved?
Parents are partners. We offer bi-monthly learning exhibitions, digital dashboards and progress reports, ethics and learning circles for families, and regular mentor-parent check-ins.

## For Professional Learners
### What kind of professionals join SynaptIQ?
We serve educators modernizing their practice, business leaders learning AI fluency, creatives and solopreneurs, and individuals seeking meaning, clarity, and leadership in the AI age.

### When do sessions happen?
Professional programs are designed for busy adults. Sessions run in the evenings, two to three times per week, with optional weekend intensives. Formats include hybrid and fully online cohorts.

### What topics are covered?
Programs focus on three dimensions: AI-era skills, human advantage skills (communication, collaboration, creativity), and ethical intelligence (moral reasoning, leadership, value-driven innovation).

### Do I need a tech background?
Not at all. We teach AI through a human lens, starting from foundational understanding. If you’re curious and mission-driven, you’ll thrive here.

### Do professionals receive a certificate?
Yes. Upon completion, each learner receives a Certificate of Mastery, along with a portfolio of applied work and mentor references upon request.

### Can I join from outside Canada?
Absolutely. Our evening professional programs are open to global learners, and time zones are considered when forming cohorts.

### Do you offer team programs for organizations?
Yes. We provide bespoke training for schools, businesses, and leadership teams looking to integrate AI, ethics, and innovation into their culture.
